- **2026-06-11c** · 3 units · DS1–DS4 dataset items queued (STS, WAC/ECM EPDs,
  [%eval] games, more puzzle themes) · R15 relative pins + exploit-pin mapping ·
  recall harness now line-wide (themes are line-level): pin 21→80, skewer 0→100,
  fork→100; floors ratcheted. Next: R-list top-down; D4 skewer wiring; sac 86%.
- **2026-06-11b** · 2 units · I1 fixtures (HF /rows scan, 10×200 puzzles) + I2
  recall harness. Baseline: hanging/mateIn1 100%, sac 75%, trapped 72%, discAtk
  63%, fork 62%, pin 21%, skewer 0%. Next: R-list; pin+skewer are the gaps.
- **2026-06-11** · setup · Built the workshop (README/TODO/TRACKER), audited
  reading list vs V2 (9 concepts already done), merged backlogs, wrote puzzle
  fetch script. Next: I1 fixtures → I2 recall harness.
